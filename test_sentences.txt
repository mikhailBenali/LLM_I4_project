Climate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment. Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common.

The World Meteorological Organization estimates there is almost a 50% chance of the five-year average global temperature exceeding +1.5 °C between 2024 and 2028. The IPCC expects the 20-year average to exceed +1.5 °C in the early 2030s.
